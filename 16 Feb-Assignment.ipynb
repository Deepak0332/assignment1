    "A database is a collection of organized data that can be accessed, managed, and updated easily. It stores data in a structured format and provides a way to retrieve and manipulate that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that store data in tables with predefined relationships between them. SQL databases are highly structured and require a schema to be defined before data can be added. They are best suited for applications that require complex queries and transactions, such as financial systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that store data in a more flexible format, such as key-value pairs, documents, or graphs. They do not require a predefined schema and can easily handle large amounts of unstructured data. NoSQL databases are best suited for applications that require high scalability and performance, such as social media platforms or e-commerce sites."

    "## Answer:\n",
    "**Primary Key:** A primary key is a field or combination of fields in a relational database table that uniquely identifies each record in the table. It is a unique identifier for a particular record in a table and ensures that each record in the table is unique and identifiable. The primary key constraint ensures that the values in the specified column(s) of a table are unique and not null. Typically, a primary key is used as the basis for other tables to reference in establishing relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Foreign Key:** A foreign key is a field or combination of fields in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a link between two tables and ensures that data in related tables is consistent. The foreign key constraint specifies that the values in a particular column or set of columns in one table must match the values in the primary key column(s) of another table. This ensures that data is correctly related between the tables and maintains data integrity. The foreign key also allows for data to be easily retrieved across multiple tables that are related to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a primary key is used to uniquely identify each row in a table, while a foreign key is used to establish relationships between tables by referencing the primary key of another table. Primary and foreign keys are essential for maintaining data consistency and integrity in a relational database."
